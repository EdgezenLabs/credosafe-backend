# app/services/auth_service.py

# Define the AuthService class that is being imported by app/routes/auth.py
class AuthService:
    # You can add a placeholder pass statement for now
    pass

# You may also need a placeholder function if your route is calling it immediately,
# but usually, just defining the class is enough to get the server started.
